                <h2>Fun facts about me:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've been coding since 2006, when I started my own website: LIFunKids.com.</li>
                    <li>I worked as a web developer/designer for Long Island University from 2012-2016.</li>
                    <li>I am a certified teacher and a school library and educational technology specialist for one of the best high schools on Long Island.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ginarusso" target="_blank">Here</a> is my professional portfolio and <a href="http://readthinkcode.org/" target="_blank">website</a>.</li>
                    <li>I believe coding is a literacy - one of the basic fundamentals of learning. It engages computational thinking, which fosters creativity and helps students to become proficient in critical thinking and supports problem-solving across all disciplines. I enjoy teaching students through an engaging, hands-on approach using microcontrollers, servo motors, light emitting diodes, breadboards, resistors, and other components. When students learn about physical computing, they are building the foundational skills needed to thrive in a competitive world.</li>
                    <li>I am looking for a fully-remote coding job!</li>
                    <li><a href="https://scrimba.com/scrim/cMW9J8uv" target="_blank">Here is my first attempt</a> at creating a scrim.</li>
                </ul>
